	 			<p> Jyotirlingas are sacred shrines of Lord Shiva; it is believed that Lord Shiva himself visited these places and hence they have a special place in the hearts of devotees. There are 12 of them in India.

Jyotirlinga means ‘column or pillar of light’. The ‘stambha’ symbol represents that there is no beginning or end. Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga is situated near the famous city of Indore, Madhya Pradesh. This is called fourth major Jyotirlinga of Shiv ji. In Omkareshwar, two forms of Jyotirlinga are worshiped on Omkareshwar and Mamleswar. Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga Jyotirlinga has been called 'God Ling' in Shiva Mahapurana. This is how the story of Lord Shiva appeared in this shrine or how it was established.</p>
